## Abstract

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces a new level of functionality for Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling direct interaction with external tools and services. Despite its potential to expand the usefulness of AI assistants, this approach also opens up unfamiliar security risks that remain largely unexplored in current research. We present MCP implementations' first comprehensive security analysis, identifying critical vulnerabilities across filesystem, database, and API integration servers. Through systematic penetration testing of $15$ MCP server implementations, we demonstrate successful exploitation of directory traversal, SQL injection, credential extraction, and resource exhaustion attacks. Our analysis reveals that $87\%$  of tested MCP servers contain at least one critical vulnerability, with $34\%$  allowing complete system compromise. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy of MCP security threats and present practical defense mechanisms that reduce attack success rates by up to $94\%$. This work establishes the foundation for secure MCP deployment and highlights the critical need for security-first design in LLM integration protocols.

## MCP Architecture

The diagram shows a traditional architecture lacking MCP, where models interact with tools in an ad hoc or tightly coupled manner, limiting scalability and interoperability.
